// A monitored value's QUALITY and SOURCE TIME must reach Dart.
//
// Before this suite existed the monitored-item callback read `value.ref.status`
// only to throw the sample away: anything but Good became
// `controller.addError('Failed to read value: <english>')` and returned, and
// `value.ref.sourceTimestamp` was never read at all. A consumer could therefore
// only ever say "the moment I heard about it", and could not say
// BadOutOfRange at all.
//
// What UA_DataValue actually carries, MEASURED against the in-process server on
// 2026-09-01 (macOS arm64, open62541 as pinned by hook/build.dart) rather than
// assumed. ffigen does not emit the C bitfield members individually; the
// generated struct ends with a single `@UA_Byte() external int substitute`,
// which IS the packed storage unit for the six flags. Bit positions follow the
// C declaration order in `include/open62541/types.h`:
//
//     bit 0 (0x01)  hasValue
//     bit 1 (0x02)  hasStatus
//     bit 2 (0x04)  hasSourceTimestamp
//     bit 3 (0x08)  hasServerTimestamp
//     bit 4 (0x10)  hasSourcePicoseconds
//     bit 5 (0x20)  hasServerPicoseconds
//
// Observed notifications for a four-attribute monitor of a healthy Int32:
//     VALUE        status=0x0        substitute=0b00000101  src=1343276754998...
//     DATATYPE     status=0x0        substitute=0b00000001  src=0
//     DESCRIPTION  status=0x0        substitute=0b00000001  src=0
//     DISPLAYNAME  status=0x0        substitute=0b00000001  src=0
// and for a data-source node whose read refuses:
//     VALUE        status=0x80020000 substitute=0b00000110  src=1343276755242...
//
// Three consequences the implementation must respect, each pinned below:
//   1. Only the VALUE attribute carries a sourceTimestamp; the other three
//      arrive with src=0 and hasSourceTimestamp clear. Recording a timestamp
//      from those would clobber the real one with the year 1601.
//   2. A Bad sample has hasValue CLEAR — there is no payload to decode. Its
//      quality is still news.
//   3. hasStatus is clear on a Good sample and the status field reads 0, which
//      is exactly UA_STATUSCODE_GOOD. An absent status means Good (OPC UA Part
//      4); the raw field is therefore safe to record unconditionally.
//
// The default lane runs this file on purpose: an `integration`/`plc` tag would
// make it local-only and it would prove nothing in CI.
